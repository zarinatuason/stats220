# stats220

* **This is my repo for STATS 220**

## A little about me:

1. I am undertaking a **degree** in *BSc IT Management & Statistics*
2. I am taking STATS 220 because I enjoy the interactive lectures and hands-on experience 
3. I am interested in learning about the mindset and perspective in exploring and understanding the process of data acquisition, storage, and management using current computer technologies and softwares. 
4. For our first project, we will be using the R package [magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) to create memes by manipulating images.
   
A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://media.tenor.com/J3HvXFiSyygAAAAi/amifatcat-math.gif)
