# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in BSc IT Management & Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I enjoy the interactive lectures and hands-on experience 
- I am interested in learning about the mindset and perspective in exploring and understanding the process of data acquisition, storage, and management using current computer technologies and softwares.
